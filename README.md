## 🎯 My focus
I design and implement full-stack applications using **MongoDB · Express · React · Node.js**. I care about clean architecture, readable code, and shipping features that solve real problems. I deliver prototypes fast, iterate based on feedback, and document projects so others can run and learn from them.

---

## 🛠 Core Skills
- **Languages & Runtime:** JavaScript (ES6+), Node.js  
- **Frontend:** React (functional components, hooks), responsive UI fundamentals (HTML, CSS)  
- **Backend:** Express, RESTful API design, data modeling with MongoDB  
- **Realtime & Integrations:** WebSockets / socket-based features (where applicable)  
- **Tools:** Git, VS Code, Postgres/MongoDB local dev (where used)  
- **Practices:** Component-driven design, modular code, readable commits, clear README + setup instructions

> Note: I keep the stack focused on what matters to the product — not buzzwords. If you want a particular tech highlighted in a job application, tell me and I’ll adapt the README.

## 🚀 Selected projects (truthful & concise)
> Short, honest status + one-line problem / tech summary. Links should point to repo or demo when available.

- **Smart Waste Management & Reporting (SWaMRS)** — *In progress*  
  Building an end-to-end MERN prototype for monitoring bin fill levels, generating reports, and visualizing sensor data. (Tech: React, Node.js, MongoDB). 🔧 *Work-in-progress — README contains goals & setup.*  
  🔗 Repo: `./SWaMRS` (see pinned repo for full details)

- **AR-assisted Shopping Experience** — *Prototype complete*  
  An AR-assisted shopping front-end that overlays product information and simplified checkout flow for mobile/AR viewers. Focus: UX experiments and frontend AR integrations. 🔗 Repo: `./AR-shopping`

- **Other work / prototypes** — *Several small experiments & half-finished proofs-of-concept*  
  I keep many prototypes in progress — I list only stable/presentable repos on my profile pins. If you want to see WIP code, ask and I’ll share branches.

---

## 🧭 How I work
- Small, testable increments — I prefer working features end-to-end.  
- Clean commits & clear PR descriptions.  
- I document setup steps and usage in each repo’s README so anyone can run my projects locally.

---

## 📂 Explore my repos
1. Check the **pinned repositories** on my profile — those are my best, most presentable projects.  
2. Open a repo → read its README for setup, features, and run instructions.  
3. If something is WIP, I indicate status and next steps in the repo README.
